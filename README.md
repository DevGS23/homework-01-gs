Challenge 1: Osu Bootcamp

## Description

This project involves refactoring an existing codebase to improve its accessibility, ensuring compliance with web accessibility standards. The aim is to enhance the user experience for individuals with disabilities by making the website more navigable and usable with assistive technologies.

-   Motivation: The primary motivation is to learn and apply best practices for web accessibility, which is crucial for creating inclusive web applications.
-   Purpose: The project was built to optimize the website for search engines and improve its accessibility, demonstrating the importance of accessible web design in the industry.
-   Problem Solved: This project addresses the lack of accessibility in the existing website, ensuring that it meets specific standards and is more user-friendly for people with disabilities.
-   Learnings: Through this project, I learned the importance of semantic HTML, the role of accessibility attributes like alt for images, and the significance of a logical structure in HTML for assistive technologies.

## Installation

1. Create a new repository:
   Mkdir (name here) "press enter"
   Example: mkdir homework-challenge-01

2. Go into this folder:
   Cd homework-challenge-01

3. We want to create a new github repository out of this folder:
   Git init
   What this does: tells git it needs to do version control inside this folder: from now on all changes will be tracked.
   Should see a message: "initialized empty git repos..."

4. Create new filed OR copy if provided with startup files:
   For this specific project: go into develop folder, then copy by highlighting "index" and "assets" into your repository.
   Then put them into your github by going to the file you created (open from finder). In this case go to "bootcamp" then "homework-challenge-01", paste.

5. Type git status back in terminal: this should show the file you pasted over into BOOTCAMP folder. But not added to the repository yet.

6. To add to repository:
   Git add .

7. Create a commit create a snapshot
   Git commit –m 'starter files' (type enter)
   "starter files" is a name you created for this commit. It can be anything you want it to be

8. Push
   Git push origin main
   If no repository has been created: go to github and create a new repository.

9. If you already have the folder created (you do), you are going to push an exisiting repository from the command line.
   Git remote add origin git@github.com:DevGS23/homework-01-gs.git
   The link is for this spefic (under "code" in github

    Git branch –M main
    Sets the branch on your local folder to be main branch:

    Git push –u origin main
    Now it should send the files from your local folder to the server.

## Usage

This project refactors an existing website to enhance its accessibility, ensuring it meets web accessibility standards. The refactored code includes semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes for images, and a logical structure for headings.

-   Improves Accessibility: By using semantic HTML elements and ensuring that all images have alt attributes, the website becomes more accessible to users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.

-   Provides a Better User Experience: A well-structured and accessible website is easier to navigate and use for all users, including those with disabilities.

-   Enhanced Usability: The improvements make the website more user-friendly, providing a better experience for all visitors.
